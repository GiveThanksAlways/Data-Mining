Hello! You can run this project as a python script (PCA_project1.py) from the command line, or you can open the jupyter notebook (PCA_project1.ipynb) and run that as well.

Also, you need to run the python from the directory where the .py file is located so that it can see the folders MyoData and groundTruth in the current working directory.


The jupyter notebook formatting looks much nicer. You can run the code in that or view the PDF of when I ran the code. You can use the command line but the formatting isn't as nice. note on data directory. The data needed to be fixed. There were two errors in the structure of the data given to us for this assignment. I fixed them and I wrote a description about it in the report.
